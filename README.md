# Conquering Responsive Layouts - Final Challenge
This is my solution for Kevin Powell's Final Challenge from the Conquering Responsive Layouts course.

## Features
- Mobile-first design
- Responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Full-width backgrounds
- Sectioned layout based on the PDF design

## Approach
- Started with a mobile layout
- Used CSS Grid and Flexbox where necessary
- Added media queries for responsiveness
- Kept the content max-width consistent with the design
